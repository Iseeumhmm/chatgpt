Lol this makes me laugh Bankers are crooks just like all our politicians. Wake up people until we quit over paying for houses,vehicles and all other ridiculously over priced things the crooks will just keep laughing at us as taxpayers.

Vee-Dub RV? Mini-bago? No, it’s called a Super Bugger and it looks like someone smashed a camper into a VW Beetle.
⁣
The Super Bugger boasts an incredible amount of practicality. It has the friendly face of a @volkswagen Beetle but also a sink, a stove, and a comfy dining table just big enough for two.⁣ Despite having a height of 92 inches and the aerodynamic profile of a garden shed, it can run along at highway speeds.⁣ 

Would you spend the night in this crazy camper?
